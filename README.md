Computer graphics is one of the major facets in the computer Industry. With the help of graphics package many applications like gaming, paint brush, movies, entertainment and other innovative applications can be run.
Our objective in this mini project named “FLAPPY BIRD GAME” is to develop clone of a famous android game, Flappy bird using C++ and basic OpenGL functions.
A simple 2D illusion achieved using orthographic projection, giving the game a familiar feel as in android. With the debug mode enabled, collision checking is available. Collision detection is carried out using the known positions of the bird and the pipes can be collided with, at any given time. This makes for a very efficient collision detection. Furthermore, it has menu to restart and exit the game.
With the help of OpenGL and GLUT libraries it creates a view of the game simulation and starts the automatically when the space key is pressed while the user is present on the splash screen. The game is controlled using the ‘space’ key on keyboard or ‘left mouse click’ of the mouse.
This project also helps us to understand the capabilities of graphics system by exploiting the numerous OpenGL functions.
The most important aspect of this project is that the basic functions of OpenGL are implemented in an understandable format thus grabbing the interest of user.
